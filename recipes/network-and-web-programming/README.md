# Python Recipes for Network and Web Programming

This section is about various topics related to using Python in 
networked and distributed applications. Topics are split between using 
Python as a client to access existing services and using Python to 
implement networked services as a server. Common techniques for writing 
code involving cooperating or communicating with interpreters are also 
given.
