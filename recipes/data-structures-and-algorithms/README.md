# Python Recipes for Data Structures and Algorithms

Python provides a variety of useful built-in data structures, such as 
lists, sets, and dictionaries. For the most part, the use of these 
structures is straightforward. However, common questions concerning 
searching, sorting, ordering, and filtering often arise. Thus, the idea 
of this section is to discuss common data structures and algorithms 
involving data. In addition, treatment is given to the various data 
structures contained in the `collections` module.

* Unpacking a sequence into separate variables
* Unpacking elements from iterables of arbitrary length
* Merging two dictionaries in a basic way
