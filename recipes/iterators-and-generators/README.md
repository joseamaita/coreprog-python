# Python Recipes for Iterators and Generators

Iteration is one of Python's strongest features. At a high level, you 
might simply view iteration as a way to process items in a sequence. 
However, there is so much more that is possible, such as creating your 
own iterator objects, applying useful iteration patterns in 
the `itertools` module, making generator functions, and so forth. This 
section aims to address common problems involving iteration.

* Creating an iterator in a basic way
* Knowing origin of an iterator
* Defining an iterator with a class
